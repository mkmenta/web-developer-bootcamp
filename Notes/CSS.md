# 6. CSS: The Very Basics

## 59. What is CSS?
**(3:00):** CSS for al input text a, not all only 2n ones

input[type="text"]:nth-of-type(2n){

...

}


## 60. CSS is Huge, Don't Panic!
**(2:51):** DON'T FOLLOW W3SCHOOLS


## 62. Color & Background-Color Properties
**(5:15):** background allows to change not only color but also to image gradient etc

**(2:43):** color goes for text color


## 66. Common Text Properties
**(10:16):** letter-spacing entre letras espacio

**(9:16):** text-decorator: under/overline + extras

line-height: interlineado

**(3:14):** font-weight is how bold should be the text. It can also be set to numbers, but maybe the font is not defined for those numbers

**(2:22):** text-align aligns to the space that the element is taking, concretely the width. So a center align in a span would not make sense if the span doesn't have a width bigger than the content


## 68. The Font Family Property
**(3:14):** backup choice: font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;



# 7. The World of CSS Selectors

## 70. Universal & Element Selectors
**(3:54):** h1,h2 {} selects h1 and h2


## 71. The ID Selector
**(4:11):** #id {}


## 72. The Class Selector
**(2:58):** .class {

}


## 73. The Descendent Selector
**(0:16):** All anchor tags that are nested or descendent of an li:

li a {

}


## 74. The Adjacent & Direct-Descendent Selectors
**(1:42):** Change style of the buttons that come after inputs:

input + button {

}


## 75. The Attribute Selector
**(0:10):** style elements based on a particular attribute

input[type="text]{

}


## 76. Pseudo Classes
**(6:15):** Every two anchors change its style

a:nth-of-type(2n){

}

**(1:54):** Style elements in certain state e.g. when you hover over somtehing, or a checked checkbox:

button:hover{

}


## 77. Pseudo Elements
**(2:26):** Some specific elements:

h2::first-letter{}

p::first-line{}


## 78. The CSS Cascade
**(0:43):** CSS CASCADE!

If you set h1 to red and then h1 to purple, purple wins!!

h1{

color: red

}

h1 {

color: purple

}


## 79. WTF is Specificity
**(7:39):** section element with class whatever

section.whatever{

}

**(3:51):** But be careful about overwriting! Attributes are overwritten not SELECTORS. check video here

**(2:46):** SPECIFITY: i.e. priority

ID \> CLASS \> ELEMENT

Also

ELEMENT1 ELEMENT2 \> ELEMENT2





## 80. TIP: Chrome Dev Tools & CSS
**(1:18):** the order cascade in css can be also done by the \<link rel\> order. the second one wins


## 81. Inline Styles & Important
**(2:13):** ALSO if you do color: red !important, this wins over ALL

**(0:50):** INLINE STYLE SPECIFITY: if you do style="XX" this one wins over any css.


## 82. CSS Inheritance
**(3:41):** some elments dont inherit properties by default so you do color: inherit

**(2:35):** INHERITANCE: a section nested into body, inherits the style from body



# 8. The CSS Box Model

## 88. The Display Property
**(10:37):** inline-block: they behave as inline elments but margin padding width and height work

**(7:09):** inline elements can't have width or height and their margin and padding is mostly ignored

**(3:50):** Convert a block attribute as an inline and vice-versa:

display: inline;


## 89. CSS Units Revisited
**(1:27):** width 50Â·% half the width of the parent

line-height 50% half the font size of the element


## 90. CSS Units: ems
**(6:58):** also for margin etc, so I guess it only inherits when its font

**(3:41):** for margin and padding em is relative to the font size of the ELEMENT ITSELF

**(2:42):** em: unit used for font size. It inherits the size of the parent (1em) and works relatively to that. So, if the parent has a 30px font size it will work relative to that


## 91. CSS Units: rems
**(6:03):** a good use case for ems is the rounded border of a button, we want it to scale if we scale the font size of the button so that it loooks the same at different sizes

**(2:55):** rems are relative to the root html element's font size so I would say ITS BETTER TO USE THIS

**(2:30):** ems have a problem: with nested elements e.g. ul li ... they inherit recursively and end up being too small or too big



# 9. Other Assorted Useful CSS Properties

## 93. Opacity & The Alpha Channel
**(3:51):** opacity turn all the element transparent including text, otherwise use rgba


## 94. The Position Property
**(1:26):** position:

static is the default,

relative: push in (top, bottom...) relatively to where it should be if it was static

absolute: it is like on top of everything and its position is relative to the top left corner of its parent THAT HAS A POSITION != STATIC

fixed: like absolute but always relative to the page


## 95. CSS Transitions (yay!)
**(6:51):** transition-timing-function: how the transition is made

**(3:57):** you can also specify what has transition: background-color 3s; or a delay XXX 3s 1s;

**(2:34):** transition if you change from a style to another it animates. you can use it with hover but also with JS


## 96. The Power of CSS Transforms
**(4:59):** transform: you can rotate scale etc. I guess it will be more useful with JS

**(1:41):** margin auto centers the element in its container


## 98. The Truth About Background
**(2:02):** we can use background to define all the background parameters altogether



# 10. Responsive CSS & Flexbox

## 104. Flex-Direction
**(4:50):** display: flex;

flex-direction: row; column; column-reverse;...

main axes normally is row and cross axes vertical


## 105. Justify-Content
**(1:28):** justify-content: can be right left but also space-between and space-around which makes elements be justified as in word the sentences


## 106. Flex-Wrap
**(0:13):** flex-wrap: when elements are going to wrap in a new line/new column so that everything fits without resize or being on top of the others.

can be: wrap; wrap-reverse; etc. it basically defines the cross-axis


## 107. Align-Items
**(4:24):** align-items: baseline; aligns everything to the baseline of the letters/words inside. A bit weird but might be useful

**(1:38):** align-items: it affects the cross-axis. it says where to distribute elements in that axis (not when is a new line as in wrap, but always)

align-items: flex-end; center;..


## 108. Align-Content & Align-Self
**(2:54):** align-self: to modify a single element alignment

**(1:50):** align-content: how to distribute elements when multiple lines/columns.

space between etc.


## 109. Flex-Basis, Grow, & Shrink
**(3:18):** ok its a bit messy. use flex-grow flex-baseline max-width min width etc to define how to   wrap elements when display changes

**(1:17):** flex-basis: size along the main axis by DEFAULT. When there is space for it.


## 110. Flex Shorthand
**(0:26):** flex: [flex-grow] [flex-shrink] [flex-basis]


## 111. Responsive Design & Media Queries Intro
**(5:00):** @media(min-width: 800px){...} when width is 800px or more

max-width is the opposite


## 112. The Power of Media Queries
**(4:34):** @media(min-width:500px) and (max-width: 800px) {...h1{} img{}}

or you can play with order and use only min-width various times so that at different points it changes
